Working on an e-commerce platform using Java and Sprinboot

Developed the models first 
1> Category Model --> Rather then keeping the model just a String , made it a class for future expansion
2> Product Model ---> Has the necessary details of a product

Currently worked only on calling third party API'S 

Next Step using My Sql and using database rather than 3rd Party Api's.
