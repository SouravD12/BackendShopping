In case of decalred queries there is a lot of abstraction happening behind the scene

To understand things in a better way , we will be using HQL queries to know what exactly is happening
behind the scenes with the queries and how are they executing.

HQL ---> Hibernate Query Language

Here we can make changes to the query depending upon our need
Instead of getting every detail about the product we can select only the fields that we need

For ex --> in the HQL query used in Product Repo i only need description and title from the product
where the price and description is given by me .
